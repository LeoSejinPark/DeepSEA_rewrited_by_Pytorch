# DeepSEA_rewrittne_by_Pytorch

Original DeepSEA was writed by Tensorflow and the version is too old to run on python 3.7.
So I rewrited DeepSEA with Pytorch and added new version, where CNN+LSTM+Attention for predicting non-coding variance. 

There is no dataset, but you can get that from https://github.com/jimmyyhwu/deepsea or https://github.com/uci-cbcl/DanQ.
